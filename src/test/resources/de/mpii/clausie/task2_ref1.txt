Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" leaves all of the explanations of wizardry behind and plunges quickly into an adventure that's darker and scarier than anything in the first Harry Potter movie.
The second in a planned series of seven Potter films is brimming with invention and new ideas, and its Hogwarts School seems to expand and deepen before our very eyes into a world large enough to conceal unguessable secrets.
The young heroes find themselves in many tense situations: in a flying car, surrounded by giant spiders, and facing a giant serpent with Medusa-like abilities.
Harry and his best friends Ron and Hermione may partake in plenty of rule-breaking at school but they are great role models; fierce and loyal friends 'til the end and willing to do whatever it takes to save their fellow students.
Parents need to know that this exciting fantasy may motivate children to tackle its greater length and complexity and play imaginative games.
